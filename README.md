## Overview

Welcome to the **OUI Standards & Development Guides** repository. This comprehensive resource is designed to provide clear, consistent, and professional development standards for all OUI projects. Whether you're a public contributor or an OUI employee, this repository serves as your definitive guide for building high-quality, maintainable software within the OUI ecosystem.

## Mission Statement

Our mission is to establish and maintain unified development standards that ensure:
- **Consistency** across all OUI projects
- **Quality** through proven best practices
- **Collaboration** by providing clear guidelines for contributors
- **Maintainability** through structured development approaches

## Important Guidelines

### Hierarchy Rules
When working with existing codebases, please follow this priority order:

1. **Legacy Codebase Rules**: If you're working on an existing legacy codebase, follow the established patterns and conventions of that specific project
2. **Migration Exception**: The above rule does not apply when you are actively porting a legacy project to comply with the new OUI standards
3. **New Projects**: All new projects must strictly adhere to the guidelines outlined in this repository

> **Note**: This repository is actively evolving. New standards, guides, and best practices are continuously being added to expand our development framework.

## Documentation Structure

### C Programming Standards

The following guides provide comprehensive standards for C development within the OUI ecosystem:

| Document | Description | Status |
|----------|-------------|--------|
| [Naming Guide](/guides/C/naming_guide.md) | Comprehensive naming conventions for variables, functions, types, and modules | ✅ Active |
| [Modern Error Handling Strategy](/guides/C/Error_handling_union_strategy.md) | Current recommended approach for error handling using union-based strategies | ✅ Recommended |
| [Legacy Error Handling Strategy](/guides/C/Error_handling_internal_error_strategy.md) | Previous error handling approach - maintained for legacy project compatibility | ⚠️ Deprecated |
| [Object-Oriented Programming Emulation](/guides/C/POO_emulation.md) | Techniques and patterns for implementing OOP concepts in C | ✅ Active |

## Getting Started
